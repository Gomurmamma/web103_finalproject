## About

### Description and Purpose

SoundSphere is a client-database web application that facilitates a platform where artists can connect with fans, and fans with artists. With recent changes in ownership for Bandcamp impacting the way it operates, we recognize an opportunity to provide a valuable service to both content creators and fans alike. Accordingly, with SoundSphere artists will be able to upload their discography and details for fans to purchase. With the transactional data that's collected, SoundSphere will have the opportunity to provide artists with the personal analytics they need to build their business, and more effectively connect with the people that love their work. Furthermore, this transactional data can be used by the SoundSphere platform to generate editorial content and make recommendations to fans looking for more of what they enjoy. For content creators, SoundSphere has the additional opportunity to offer a more equitable transaction rate than Bandcamp offers. Additionally, for employees, SoundSphere presents an opportunity to pursue a line of work they are passionate about with the benefits of the labor union they collectively choose.

### Inspiration

Bandcamp.com is an online music distribution platform recently sold by Epic Games to Songtradr. Users have collectively spent over $1.19 billion via the Bandcamp client applications. This includes 14 million albums, 10 million tracks, 1.8 million vinyl records, and 100,000 t-shirts this year alone. As such, high systematization is needed to process these user-driven payments. Furthermore, a database driven backend is necessary to store the larger quantities of data, much of it being audio files, release information, album art, customer profiles, etc... The database driven backend, then, will track the Artist and their Releases. These Releases will have a set of Tracks, and once a specific Customer has found a release to purchase, they can place an Order. To track the number of orders a Release has received, it will be connected to ReleaseOrders, which will also be connected to Orders. This backend will prop up a large, ecommerce platform, and as such, it will handle a constant inflow of transactions warranting a database.
