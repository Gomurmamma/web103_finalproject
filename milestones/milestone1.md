## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We had a great planning conversation during our initial meeting as a group. During that time we went over our top choices for a project topics and came together to choose a digital download platform similar to Bandcamp in the end. For both of us, it was important to choose a project that not only met a realistic market demand, but also provided us the opportunity to develop considerable value driven web app features.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We were having trouble communicating given our schedules and lack of planning. Despite this challenge, we managed to complete the first milestone anyways as a result of the initial group discussion. For our next group meeting we can improve our standing by setting up our preferred communication channel and choosing a time outside of Codepath to touch base about our progress.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

1. Recommendations on implementing Passport.js in our projects would be helpful. Is there anything especially relevant to working with PostgreSQL or with planning our database that we will need to keep in mind in order to implement authentication?
