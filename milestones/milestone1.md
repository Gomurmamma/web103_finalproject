## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We had a great planning conversation during our initial meeting as a group. During that time we went over our top choices for a project topics and came together to choose a digital download platform similar to Bandcamp in the end. For both of us, it was important to choose a project that not only met a realistic market demand, but also provided us the opportunity to develop value driven web app features.
