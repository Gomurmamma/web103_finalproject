## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Despite some setbacks with internet connectivity and other technical issues, we were able to stay on top of our work and find other times to touch base and trouble shoot the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Initially we forgot to go over the routing for the project. W realized that information we were assuming to be in the URL params needed to be specified and consistent for the client and server. We arranged for an extra meeting to go over these decisions and took care of the routing without any further issues.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

All of the tasks in the sprint planning are nearly complete. We need to connect the backend and frontend to have final confirmation that the features work as intended. Otherwise nearly all of the development goals for this week were met.

From this point we'll be in fair shape to finish the frontend since the majority of the backend is defined at the end of this sprint. This will enable us to focus on the remaining frontend features, and if time permits, return to the backend to add in authentication.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The other features at risk are the Artist Dashboard features and the different User registration features.

If these items remain at risk then we will likely need to shift our focus to working on a single feature instead of going for both.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Information on how we will be deploying the project will be helpful so we can make sure the repository is exhibiting good hygiene before then.
