## Reflection

1. What went well during this unit?

We found time during the week to meetup and I think we communicated pretty well during this sprint considering the demands of school, work, life, etc.

2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We were unfamiliar with github collaboration features so it took a little bit in the beginning to learn how to make a github project board, create issues, create milestones, etc.

3. Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we did not plan to implement any features during this sprint, only to sketch out our project board and create a plan.

4. Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Our custom / stretch feature are "at risk" like authentication, for example, due to time constraints. If we don't end up having time, we will have to save those features for a later date.

5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
I (Jerry) definitely need some additional help understanding conceptually how code transmits data from front end to back end, server to client, model to view to controller, etc. I plan to utilize the course labs and tutorials in order to get caught up to speed.
